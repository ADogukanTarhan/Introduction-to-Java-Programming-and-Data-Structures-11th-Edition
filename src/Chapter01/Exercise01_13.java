/**
 * (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following 2 * 2 system of linear
 * equation:
 * ax + by = e  cx + dy = f
 * x = (ed-bf)/(ad-bc)  y = (af-ec)/(ad-bc)
 * Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
 * 3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5  2.1x + .55y = 5.9
