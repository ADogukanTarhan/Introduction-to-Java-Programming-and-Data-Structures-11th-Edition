/**
 * (Geometry: two rectangles) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center x-, y-coordinates, width, and
 * height of two rectangles and determines whether the second rectangle is inside the first or overlaps with the first,
 * as shown in FigureÂ 3.9. Test your program to cover all cases.
 *
 * Here are the sample runs:
 * Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 2.5 4 2.5 43
 * Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1.5 5 0.5 3
 * r2 is inside r1
 * Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1 2 3 5.5
 * Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 3 4 4.5 5
 * r2 overlaps r1
 * Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1 2 3 3
 * Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 40 45 3 2
 * r2 does not overlap r1
