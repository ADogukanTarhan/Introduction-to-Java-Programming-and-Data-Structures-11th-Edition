/**
 * (Find future dates) Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer for
 * todayâ€™s day of the week (Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, . . . , and Saturday is 6). Also
 * prompt the user to enter the number of days after today for a future day and display
 * the future day of the week.
 *
 * Here is a sample run:
 * Enter today's day: 1
 * Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 3
 * Today is Monday and the future day is Thursday
 * Enter today's day: 0
 * Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 31
 * Today is Sunday and the future day is Wednesday
