# Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures 11th Edition

**[This repository](https://github.com/Sven97/Introduction-to-Java-Programming-and-Data-Structures-11th-Edition/)** contains my personal solutions to **programming exercises** in the textbook - [Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures Comprehensive Version Eleventh Edition](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Liang-Introduction-to-Java-Programming-and-Data-Structures-Comprehensive-Version-Plus-My-Lab-Programming-with-Pearson-e-Text-Access-Card-Package-11th-Edition/PGM2297842.html) written by [Y. Daniel Liang](https://yongdanielliang.github.io/).

This book is very systematic and well-organized. It definitely is a good choice for Java beginner to start. Suggested solutions to part of exercises are provided by the author, but only the registered instructors have access to them from Pearson website. I'm trying to finish all the exercises in this book (very slowly üê¢). If you come across any difficulties in completing these exercises, I will be very happy if my solution can provide some insights more or less. If I haven't solved the exercise you are facing, please do let me know, I'll update the solution preferentially. Moreover, contributions of any kind to this project are welcome!

Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback if you find any error in my code or any improvement can be made with my solutions. You can simply press the "Pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the contents or simply [open an issue](https://github.com/Sven97/Introduction-to-Java-Programming-and-Data-Structures-11th-Edition/issues/new).
