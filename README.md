# Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures 11th Edition

This **[repo](https://github.com/Sven97/Introduction-to-Java-Programming-and-Data-Structures-11th-Edition/)** contains my personal solutions to programming exercises in the textbook - [Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures Comprehensive Version Eleventh Edition](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Liang-Introduction-to-Java-Programming-and-Data-Structures-Comprehensive-Version-Plus-My-Lab-Programming-with-Pearson-e-Text-Access-Card-Package-11th-Edition/PGM2297842.html) published by [Y. Daniel Liang](https://yongdanielliang.github.io/).

This book is very systematic and well-orginized. It definelitly is a good choice for Jave beginner to start. Pearson provides suggested solutions to part of the exercises, but they are only accessible to the registered instructors. I'm trying to finish the exercises in this book (slowly üê¢ lol). If you come across any difficulties in completing these exercises, I will be very happy if my solution can provide some insights more or less. If I haven't solved the exercise you are facing, please do let me know, I'll update the solution preferentially.

Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback if you find any error in my code or any adjustment is needed with my solutions. You can simply press the "Pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the contents or simply [open an issue](https://github.com/Sven97/Introduction-to-Java-Programming-and-Data-Structures-11th-Edition/issues/new) in [this repository](https://github.com/Sven97/Introduction-to-Java-Programming-and-Data-Structures-11th-Edition/)
